<b>Hiram Abif's Artefact</b><br /><br />

Do Freemason play computer games? Well...., yes, after all, we are also humans.<br /><br />

Do not expect that <a href="react/hiram_game.html">Hiram Abif's Artefact</a> game will disclose our secrets to you.
Quite contrary, it is based on completely fabricated story.
<br /><br />
However, it has several masonic overtones. In particular:<br />
<ul>
<li>It teaches a long forgotten skill of performing calculations on a stick.</li>
<li>It teaches mathematics, one of the liberal arts, which we, indeed, practice.</li>
<li>It promotes learning and self-improvement, which is what Freemasonry is all about.</li>
<li>The story-line references ancient times, which has a lot to do with our tradition.</li>
<li>Knight Templars now exist as a separate degree in Freemasonry.</li>
<li>It touches the topic of alchemy, which some of our members are interested in.</li>
<li>Nicolaus Copernicus, who appears in the game, is the parton of our lodge.</li>
<li>The game requires patience and discipline of mind.</li>
</ul>
